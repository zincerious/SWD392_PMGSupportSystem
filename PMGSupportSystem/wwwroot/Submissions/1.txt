5. Project schedule:
(Note: A3 = done in day 3rd)
* A3 -> B8 -> E13 -> H17 (17 work days)
* A3 -> B8 -> D11 -> G16 (16 work days)
* A3 -> B8 -> C10 -> F13 (13 work days) -> wait for G in 3 days
-> I19 -> (add with H then end)
=> 3+5+5+4+2= 19 work days
- Describe: We can done 8 work days to complete Activity A and B. After that, Activity C, E and D can run at the same time and move to their next Activity (in order is H, G and F), it would take around 16-17 days. Activity I will be the last activity of all the paths, as it been done after Activity H 2 days. The project end with H and I activity's results.
    
After 5 days, when we still work in Activity B, there're a request to  speed up so that the project would finish 3 days sooner. Recommendation: 
- As we have to wait for the Activity G in 3 days, all members in Activity F are free to help in Activity G. 
- We can reduce some addition details or qualification to finish sooner.
- Add for more budget to pay for team's member to work over time.
