1. Five Main Project Stakeholders

Project Sponsor: Provides funding and approves major project deliverables, including the final system. Makes key strategic decisions and ensures alignment with business goals.

Project Manager: Oversees project planning, scheduling, budgeting, and reporting. Coordinates between teams and stakeholders. Ensures deliverables are met on time and within budget.

UI/UX Designer: Designs all system interfaces, ensuring usability and accessibility for different roles (salespeople, managers, etc.). Responsible for mockups and visual consistency.

Software Developer: Implements core functionalities based on requirements. Responsible for writing, testing, and deploying code.

Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: Validates that the system meets all business and technical requirements. Conducts manual and automated testing and reports defects.

4. Five Project Risks and Mitigation Plans

Time Overrun

Description: Project may not meet deadline.

Mitigation: Regular sprint reviews, buffer in timeline.

Contingency: Reduce scope or request extension.

Budget Overrun

Description: Expenses may exceed allocated budget.

Mitigation: Track expenses weekly.

Contingency: Reallocate funds, seek additional support.

Scope Creep (Extra Functionality Requested)

Description: Client adds 3 new functions unexpectedly.

Mitigation: Change control process.

Contingency: Adjust timeline, budget.

Impossible Technical Request

Description: Clients request unfeasible features.

Mitigation: Early technical discussions.

Contingency: Negotiate trade-offs.

Office Fire Incident

Description: Loss of workspace/resources.

Mitigation: Use cloud backup, remote tools.

Contingency: Enable remote work, use coworking space.

5. Project Schedule and Critical Path

Activity Table (from Excel):

Start -> A (3) -> B (5)
Paths:
  B -> C (2) -> F (3) -> I (3) = 13 days
  B -> D (3) -> G (5) -> I (3) = 16 days
  B -> E (5) -> H (4) -> I (3) = 17 days (Critical Path)

Critical Path: Start → A → B → E → H → I = 3 + 5 + 5 + 4 + 3 = 20 days

Speed-Up Recommendation:

Goal: Reduce duration by 3 days (from 20 to 17)

Solution 1: Reallocate Team from F to G during Wait Period

Explanation: After C-F path finishes in 13 days, members in F have 4 idle days.

Help: They can assist in G to reduce G from 5 → 2-3 days.

Impact: Might affect focus but accelerates G and I.

Solution 2: Reduce Scope or Optimize Testing

Explanation: Simplify non-essential features or reduce manual testing.

Help: Shortens duration without major resource cost.

Impact: Slight quality compromise if not balanced.

Assumptions:

Team has overlapping skills to support other activities.

Tasks can be parallelized and do not have heavy interdependencies beyond defined order.

Budget is flexible to allow overtime or additional tools if required.
